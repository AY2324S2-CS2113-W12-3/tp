### Summary of Contributions
- Features:
    - Implemented BaseMap as a template class to allow seamless transitions between what is being displayed on the main 
       screen of the User Interface.
    - Implemented BattleInterface to handle player-enemy interactions as well as to display relevant ASCII art for
      aesthetics.
    - Implemented ShopMap to handle player-ShopKeeper interactions as well as to display the relevant ASCII art.
    - Implemented the HintHandler class which creates invisible triggers around the map which gives the player hints,
      or messages, similar to other, currently existing, games.
    - Implemented TextBox. TextBox is a class that supplements the main UI display towards the bottom of the screen.
      It handles the error messages, narration messages, dialogue from entities, player instructions in a nicely
      formatted manner.
    - Implemented PlayerStatus. PlayerStatus is another supplementary class in addition to the main UI display. It 
      handles the tracking of the health, money and exp statistic of the player.
    - Implemented the Math Package. This package allows the team to quickly create math questions and answers and sort 
      them by difficulty to properly determine the questions being asked by the various enemies on the map.
    - Implemented the skeleton of the Consumable item class.
